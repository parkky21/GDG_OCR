Subject: Ethics in AI

Assignment 1

Q1:
→ Ethics in AI and ML is essential for the responsible
development and use of these technologies. It
ensures:
i) Fairness: Prevents biases in algorithms, ensuring
decisions are impartial and equitable
for all individuals.

ii) Transparency: Promotes clarity in how AI systems
make decisions, enabling users to
understand and trust their process.

iii) Privacy Protection: Safeguards personal data and
ensures AI systems respect user
privacy.

iv) Accountability: Establishes clear responsibility
for the actions and outcomes of AI
systems.

v) Safety and Well-Being: Ensures AI technologies
are safe, aligned with
human values, and do not cause harm to individuals
or society.

92.
→Here are some strategies to overcome challenges to
ethical AI:
i) Bias Mitigation : Implement diverse, representative
datasets and use techniques like
fairness-aware algorithms.

ii) Transparency & Explainability: Develop XAI models that
allow users to understand how decisions are made.

iii) Privacy & Protection: Adopt privacy-preserving techniques,
such as differential privacy, data
anonymization, to protect sensitive user data.

iv) Accountability and Regulation: Establish clear accountability
frameworks & regulatory
standards to ensure responsible AI.

v) Continuous Monitoring & Auditing: Regularly audit AI
systems for ethical
concerns, ensure compliance with standards, and adjust
models as needed to correct issues.

These strategies can help ensure AI is developed and
used responsibly, ethically, and for the benefit of all.

93.
→The dimensions of accountability in AI include:
i) Developers Accountability: Ensuring ethical design and
development of AI systems,
ensuring not causing harm.

ii) Organizational Accountability: Companies ensuring responsi-
ble deployment and ethical
use of AI.

iii) Legal Accountability : Compliance with laws and
regulations governing the AI
systems.

iv) Operational Accountability : Ongoing monitoring to
ensure ethical AI
performance in real word use.

v) User Accountability : Users responsibly interacting
with AI systems and reporting
issues.

vi) Societal Accountability : Governments ensuring
the creation and enforce-
ment of ethical AI frameworks.

Q4.
→
Transparency in AI/ML is crucial for several
reasons:

i) Trust and Accountability : Users and stakeholders
need to understand how
AI models make decisions to build trust and
ensure accountability.

ii) Bias Detection and Fairness : Transparent and
help identify and mitigate biases, ensuring
fairness in decision-making.

iii) Regulatory Compliance : Many industries require
XAI to meet legal and ethical standards.

iv) Debugging and Improvement – Understanding model decisions
allows developers to diagnose
errors and improve performance.

v) User Understanding and Control: Transparent AI empowers
users to interpret
predictions and take appropriate actions.

vi) Ethical AI Development: Transparency helps align AI systems
with ethical considerations and
societal values.

95.
→ Dataset Bias occurs when training data is unrepresentative or skewed, leading to unfair AI predictions. It can
arise due to sampling bias, measurement bias, or
historical bias.

Ways to reduce Dataset Bias:
i) Use Diverse Data: Ensure representation from all groups.
ii) Balance the Dataset: Apply oversampling, undersampling, or
augmentation.
iii) Detect Bias: Use fairness metrics and auditing tools.
iv) Apply Fairness Algorithms: Use de-biasing techniques
like re-weighting.
v) Human Oversight: Regularly review data and model
decisions.
